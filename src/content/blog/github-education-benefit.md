## 1. Prerequisites: What You Need Before Applying ✅

Before starting the application process, gather the following items:

**Pro Tip:** Using your mobile phone for the application process is recommended for easier photo uploads and location sharing.

### Required Items:

- **A GitHub Account**: Create one at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) if you don't already have an account. Ensure your [profile name and address](https://github.com/settings/profile) match the details on your student ID card exactly.
  
- **Current Academic Enrollment**: You must be actively enrolled in an Officially recognized degree or diploma program (high school, secondary school, college, university, bootcamp, or similar educational institution).

- **School-Issued Email Address**: An institutional email (typically ending in **.edu**, **.edu.np**, or your school's specific domain like studentname@university.edu.np) provides the easiest verification path. If you don't have a school email, contact your institution's IT department or academic advisor to request one—most institutions provide these to enrolled students.

- **Proof of Current Enrollment**: You'll need to upload valid documentation showing your **current enrollment status** and **enrollment date**. Acceptable documents include:
  - Student ID card with expiration date
  - Official transcript showing current semester
  - Enrollment verification letter from your institution
  - Student portals

**Important:** Your proof must show you are **currently enrolled**, not that you were enrolled in the past.

## 2. Step-by-Step Application Process 📝

Follow these steps carefully to maximize your chances of approval:

### Step 1: Update Your GitHub Profile

Ensure your GitHub profile information matches your student documentation exactly:

1. Visit your [GitHub profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile)
2. Update your **full name** to match your student ID
3. Add your current **location** (city and country)
4. Add your school email at [github.com/settings/emails](https://github.com/settings/emails)
5. **Verify your school email** by clicking the link GitHub sends

**Why this matters:** GitHub uses this information to verify your identity and academic affiliation.

### Step 2: Complete Billing Information

Navigate to the [Billing Information Page](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information).

![Billing Information Page](/blogs_assets/github-education-benefit/billing-info.png)

Fill in your payment information with the same name and address from your GitHub profile and student ID.

**Why billing info for free benefits?** GitHub uses this information to verify your identity and location—you won't be charged anything. This step helps prevent fraud and ensures benefits go to legitimate students.

**Recommendation:** After completing this form, log out of GitHub and log back in before proceeding. This ensures all your information is properly saved in GitHub's system.

### Step 3: Start Your Education Benefits Application

Go to the [GitHub Education Benefits Page](https://github.com/settings/education/benefits).

![Benefit Application Form](/blogs_assets/github-education-benefit/benefit-form.png)

Follow these steps in order:

1. Click the **"Start an application"** button
2. Select your role as **"Student"**
3. Search for and select your school from the institution list
4. Choose your verified school email from the dropdown menu
5. Click **"Share location"** when prompted (this helps verify you're near your institution)
6. Describe how you plan to use GitHub (be specific: mention projects, coursework, or learning goals)

**Note:** If your institution isn't listed, you can add it manually by entering the school name."

**Important Note on School Name:** Use your actual college or campus name rather than the affiliated university name. For example:

Use "Birendra Multiple Campus" instead of "Tribhuvan University"

### Step 4: Upload Proof of Academic Status

Upload a **clear, high-resolution image** of your proof of enrollment. 

**Document Requirements:**
- Must show your **full name** (matching your GitHub profile)
- Must show **current academic year or semester**
- Must show an **expiration date** or **enrollment date** proving current status
- All text must be **clearly legible**

**For Non-English Calendars:** If your institution uses B.S. (Bikram Sambat), Nepali calendar, or another calendar system, create a side-by-side image showing:
- Your original document
- A date conversion showing the equivalent year (use an online converter)

This helps GitHub reviewers understand that your enrollment is current.

**Pro Tip:** Take the photo in good lighting against a dark background. Avoid shadows and ensure all corners of the document are visible.

### Step 5: Submit and Wait for Approval

After clicking submit, you'll receive a confirmation screen.

**Approval Timeline:**
- **With .edu or .edu.np email:** Often approved within 24-48 hours
- **Without school email domain:** May take 3-7 business days for manual review
- **After approval:** Benefits activate within 72 hours (3 days)

You'll receive an email notification once your application is approved. Check your GitHub Education dashboard to confirm your benefits are active.

## 3. Common Issues and Troubleshooting ⚠️

If your application is rejected, review these common issues:

### Issue: "We were unable to verify your academic affiliation"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure your uploaded document is **high resolution** and all text is clearly readable
- Verify your **name** on the document matches your GitHub profile exactly (including middle names or initials)

### Issue: Application pending for over 2 weeks

**Solutions:**
- Check if GitHub requested additional information via email
