## ðŸ‘€ Want to contribute?

Feel free to check [Contribution Methods](CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

**Make sure that Prettier is installed in your text editor.** Add this to your `settings.json` in VS Code, as Prettier alone will not format Astro files correctly. You need this additional formatter for Astro. The npm plugins are taken care with devDependencies you don't have to worry about that.

`{
  "prettier.documentSelectors": ["**/*.astro"],
  "[astro]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  }
}`

You can also run this command for installing the extension. Open up the terminal in vscode and paste this line .

`ext install astro-build.astro-vscode`
